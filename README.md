# SoundConcepts

This is a small libary to handle the SoundConcepts API requests. It is currently in development, so use at your ownr risk! Actually there isn't much risk involved, it really is just not built out as far as it could be.

It requires the Nubersoft class library `rasclatt/nubersoft` and requires others besides that one.
